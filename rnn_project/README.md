# RNN Project

This project demonstrates a minimal Recurrent Neural Network using PyTorch.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch

Install requirements with:

```bash
pip install torch
```

## Running

Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py
```

The script trains a small RNN on a dummy dataset and prints the loss after each epoch.
